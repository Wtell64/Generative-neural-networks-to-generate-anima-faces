# Generative-neural-networks-to-generate-anima-faces
This project was done for an deep learning course in Leiden University.

We used GAN and VAE neural networks to train on anime faces and used it to generate new unseen anime faces.

We used this type of dataset due to the simplistic nature of the respected face images.
